# Luigi, No!

A game a bout a dog trying to pee.

WASD or the arrows moves your dog. You pee automatically (you're desperate for a wee!) and the game ends when you're out of pee.
You can hold your pee for a short time, the black bar below the pee bar shows how much you can hold it in.
You gain points by filling up the mystic orbs with your pee, and lose points if Luigi drinks them.
